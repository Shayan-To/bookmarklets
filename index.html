<h1><a href="https://github.com/janmoesen/bookmarklets">Jan Moesen's bookmarklets</a></h1>
<p>
	Time-saving and life-enhancing (ahem) bookmarklets.

<h2>Installation instructions</h2>
<p>
	Download <a download href="https://raw.github.com/janmoesen/bookmarklets/master/bookmarks.html"><code>bookmarks.html</code></a>
	and import it into your bookmarks manager. (Follow the instructions for your browser(s) of choice:
	<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Import_bookmarks">Mozilla Firefox</a>,
	<a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=96816">Google Chrome</a>,
	<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Safari/3.0/en/9263.html">Safari</a>,
	<a href="http://help.opera.com/Mac/12.00/en/importexport.html#importff">Opera</a>.)

<h2>Source code</h2>
<p>
	You can clone the project with <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> by running:

<pre>git clone git://github.com/<a href="https://github.com/janmoesen/bookmarklets">janmoesen/bookmarklets</a></pre>

<h2>Browser compatibility</h2>
<p>
	The bookmarklets I use the most (<q>Readable++</q>, <q>« Previous</q> and
	<q>Next »</q>) work fine in most top browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Safari
	and Opera.

<h3>Firefox</h3>
<p>
	I use Firefox for work and leisure, and all bookmarklets should work in
	the latest stable release. (Firefox 18.0.1, as of this writing.)

<p>
	The bookmarklets work mostly fine on Firefox for Android, except that you
	cannot always use the associated keywords. E.g., while tapping the
	"Readable++" bookmark from the menu works fine, typing <kbd>read</kbd>
	into the Awesomebar and then tapping the "Go" button does not.

<h3>Chrome</h3>
<p>
	The imported bookmarklets work fine, but Chrome (I have tested Chromium
	25.0.1330.0 (168483)) does not allow you to add keywords to them. Instead,
	you have to add them as custom "search engines". Enter or copy the
	bookmarklet's title and keyword into the search engine name and keyword
	fields, and copy the location with the <code>javascript:</code> protocol
	into the <q>URL with %s in place of query</q> field.

<p>
	This is a labour-intensive process, so if you know how to automate it,
	please <a href="https://github.com/janmoesen/bookmarklets/issues">let me
	know in the issue tracker</a>.

<h3>Safari</h3>
<p>
	Like in Chrome, the imported bookmarklets work fine, but Safari (my
	version: 5.1.7 (6534.57.2)) does not allow you to add keywords to them.
	<a href="http://alexstaubo.github.com/keywurl/">Keywurl</a> is a plugin
	which emulates this, but I have not tried it, and it has not been updated
	since 2010/04/01.

<h3>Opera</h3>
<p>
	The imported bookmarklets work fine and even keep their keywords, but
	Opera does not allow you to combine keywords with parameters. E.g.,
	for the Google Images search, you cannot do <kbd>img foo bar</kbd>.
	Instead, you have to enter <kbd>img</kbd>, and then type <kbd>foo
	bar</kbd> in the dialog box.
