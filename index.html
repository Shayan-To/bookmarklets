<h1><a href="https://github.com/janmoesen/bookmarklets">Jan Moesen's bookmarklets</a></h1>
<p>
	Time-saving and life-enhancing (ahem) bookmarklets.

<h2>Installation instructions</h2>
<p>
	Download <a download href="https://raw.github.com/janmoesen/bookmarklets/master/bookmarks.html"><code>bookmarks.html</code></a>
	and import it into your bookmarks manager. (Follow the instructions for your browser(s) of choice:
	<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-bookmarks-html-file">Mozilla Firefox</a>,
	<a href="https://www.google.com/search?ie=utf-8&hl=en&num=100&q=site%3Agoogle.com+chrome+import+bookmarks.html">Google Chrome</a>,
	<a href="https://www.google.com/search?ie=utf-8&hl=en&num=100&q=site%3Aapple.com+safari+import+bookmarks.html">Safari</a>,
	<a href="https://www.google.com/search?ie=utf-8&hl=en&num=100&q=site%3Aopera.com+opera+import+bookmarks.html">Opera</a>.)

<h2>Source code</h2>
<p>
	You can clone the project with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> by running:

<pre>git clone git://github.com/<a href="https://github.com/janmoesen/bookmarklets">janmoesen/bookmarklets</a></pre>

<h2>Browser compatibility</h2>
<p>
	The bookmarklets I use the most (<q>Readable++</q>, <q>« Previous</q> and
	<q>Next »</q>) work fine in most top browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Safari
	and Opera.

<h3>Firefox</h3>
<p>
	I use Firefox for work and leisure, and all bookmarklets should work in
	the latest stable release. (Firefox 37, as of this writing.)

<p>
	The bookmarklets work mostly fine on Firefox for Android, except that you
	cannot always use the associated keywords. E.g., while tapping the
	"Readable++" bookmark from the menu works fine, typing <kbd>read</kbd>
	into the Awesomebar and then tapping the "Go" button does not.

<h3>Chrome</h3>
<p>
	The imported bookmarklets work fine, but Chrome (I have tested Chromium
	44.0.2398.0) does not allow you to add keywords to them. Instead,
	<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95653">add
	them as custom "search engines"</a> to enable keywords and parameters.
	Enter or copy the bookmarklet's title and keyword into the search engine
	name and keyword fields, and copy the location with the
	<code>javascript:</code> protocol into the <q>URL with %s in place of
	query</q> field.

<p>
	This is a labour-intensive process, so if you know how to automate it,
	please <a href="https://github.com/janmoesen/bookmarklets/issues">let me
	know in the issue tracker</a>.

<h3>Safari</h3>
<p>
	Like in Chrome, the imported bookmarklets work fine, but Safari (my
	version: 7.1.6 (9537.85.15.3)) does not allow you to add keywords to them.
	<a href="http://safarikeywordsearch.aurlien.net/">Safari Keyword Search</a>
	is an extension which emulates this, but I have not tried it.

<h3>Opera</h3>
<h4>"Old" Opera (up to and including Opera 12)</h4>
<p>
	The imported bookmarklets work fine and even keep their keywords, but
	Opera does not allow you to combine keywords with parameters. E.g.,
	for the Google Images search, you cannot do <kbd>img foo bar</kbd>.
	Instead, you have to enter <kbd>img</kbd>, and then type <kbd>foo
	bar</kbd> in the dialog box.

<h4>"New" Opera (based on Blink)</h4>
<p>
	I have not tried this yet. Feel free to do so and let me know.
