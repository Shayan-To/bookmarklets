Jan Moesen's bookmarklets

A collection of time-saving and life-enhancing (ahem) bookmarklets.

I like giving my bookmarklets keywords so I can use my location bar as a
command line. (If you speak Dutch, check out http://kak.be/phl.)

The bookmarklets are stored here as separate script files. You can copy and
paste them into your bookmarks manager, or import them wholesale using the
generated "bookmarks.html" file.

Feel free to fork and create pull requests.
